## Predicting the Mega Millions Lotto with machine learning

In this project, we aim to predict the Mega Millions winning numbers using an LSTM Bidirectional model. Found in this repository are examples of webscraping, data wrangling, data preparation, and creating and using multiple machine learning models. Please use this source to learng from. I had a lot of fun making this project and I hope you enjoy!
